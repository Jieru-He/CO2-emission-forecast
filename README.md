# CO2-emission-forecast

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to produce electricity. As a result, countries adopted The Paris Agreement to limit greenhouse gases as soon as possible to combat global warming. Emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030 to stay below 1.5 Â°C. However, given the rising trend of CO2 emissions, is the goal still realistic within the expected timeframe?

To answer this question, I analyzed the trend and pattern of CO2 emissions generated by different energy sources in the USA from 1973 till the present year 2022. I also focused on the CO2 emissions from natural gas to predict its future growth.
